Addressing the four main subject areas (language arts, math, science, and social studies) and the major concepts taught within these areas, these books provide a number of different types of menus that elementary and middle school students can use to select exciting products that they will develop so that teachers can assess what has been learned-versus using a traditional worksheet format. Each book contains attractive reproducible menus, each based on the levels of Bloom s Revised taxonomy, for students to use to guide themselves in making decisions as to which products they will develop after studying a major concept or unit. Using creative and challenging choices found in Tic- Tac-Toe Menus, List Menus, 2-5-8 Menus, Baseball Menus, and Game Show Menus, students will look forward to sharing their newfound knowledge throughout the year. Also included are specific guidelines for products, rubrics for assessing student products, and teacher introduction pages for each menu."

It takes two weekends to add a zigzag bridge as a centerpiece to an iris garden or to put up an arbor. In less than a month, you can enjoy a vertical garden on a sleep slope, a heart-shaped pool with rockery, waterfall, or tea garden. The work lasts only a short time�the pleasure, forever. �Ketchell has compiled a realistic guide to constructing more than 20 outstanding Oriental garden features. Detailed directions combine with impeccable illustrations, and Ketchell�s informed explanations of construction techniques, material requirements, tools, and equipment make even the most intricate design attainable.��Booklist."

In Major Barbara, George Bernard Shaw spins out the drama of an eccentric millionaire, a romantic poet, and a misguided savior of souls, Major Barbara herself, in a topsy-turvy masterpiece of sophisticated banter and urbane humor. His brilliant dialogue, combined with his use of paradox and socialist theory, never fails to tickle, entertain-and challenge. George Bernard Shaw was the greatest British dramatist after Shakespeare, a satirist equal to Jonathan Swift, and a playwright whose most profound gift was his ability to make audiences think by provoking them to laughter."

Gerald doesn\u0027t hold out much hope that the paintings will be returned, but Dieter\u0027s earnestness speaks to him and he agrees to help. At first he concludes that while Dieter has a case, suing in Austria isn\u0027t practical. But Gerald is a good lawyer, and as his feelings for Dieter develop, so does his determination to win the case. Together, Gerald and Dieter navigate research, hearings, and a dysfunctional family in the pursuit of fine art-and discover the art of love along the way."

      "summary": "A champion of the human spirit, Henry David Thoreau is a true American mystic. Walden, which celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2004, continues to be one of the most familiar and widely published books in America. Thoreau\u0027s writings have also coined countless colloquialisms that have become commonplace in our language, among them, \"men live lives of quiet desperation\" and \"he hears a different drummer.\" Though he was not religious in any conventional sense, Thoreau entreated all those he touched to wake up, find their own way of living, and experience oneness with nature and society. In True Harvest, Barry Andrews, a noted Thoreau scholar and leading authority on the Transcendentalist movement, has collected the most provocative of these entreaties in a 365-day format of short readings. The passages are drawn from the whole of Thoreau\u0027s published works including his journals, letters, books, essays, and lectures and they reflect a wide range of topics?nature, society, politics, philosophy, ethics, education, religion, and social justice. This daybook will inspire readers to look for the spiritual throughout the year and in life\u0027s daily experiences. In addition, True Harvest is designed to help readers use Thoreau\u0027s sentiments as a daily spiritual practice?one that promotes a life of simplicity, conscious living, and quiet contemplation."

Stalin\u0027s focus was on Europe and the rising Nazi tide, but he also worried about the Japanese in the east; Japanese presence in Manchuria posed a threat to his eastern flank. In May 1939, the 129-day border war known as Khalkin Gol broke out. Minor cross-border raids escalated into full-scale clashes between the Soviet, Mongolian and Japanese armies. When, on September 1, 1939, Hitler attacked Poland, an opportunity arose for both sides to disengage, and on September 15, 1939 the war came to a close. The Soviets had lost nearly 8,000 men and suffered over 15,000 wounded. The Japanese, for their part, never officially revealed the scale of their losses, but these were undoubtedly much greater than those of the Soviets. The 129-day bloody border war would lead to an uneasy peace between the two nations from September 1939 until the dying days of World War II."

Equally important, this volume is intended to foster further research efforts - from local studies of classrooms by teachers to large-scale studies that produce generalizable understandings about learning from text.\n\nLearning From Text Across Conceptual Domains - a result of the editor\u0027s and contributors\u0027 work with National Reading Research Center - will be of interest to all researchers, graduate students, practicing teachers, and teachers in training who are interested in understanding the issues that are central to improving students learning from text."

And it turned out to be of his finest yarns, tapping into what he does best: character-driven storytelling. The setting is the small \"death house\" of a Southern prison in 1932. The Green Mile is the hall with a floor \"the color of tired old limes\" that leads to \"Old Sparky\" (the electric chair). The charming narrator is an old man, a prison guard, looking back on the events decades later. Maybe it\u0027s a little too cute (there\u0027s a smart prison mouse named Mr. Jingles), maybe the pathos is laid on a little thick, but it\u0027s hard to resist the colorful personalities and simple wonders of this supernatural tale. And it\u0027s not a bad choice for giving to someone who doesn\u0027t understand the appeal of Stephen King, because the one scene that is out-and-out gruesome (it involves \"Old Sparky\") can be easily skipped by the squeamish. The Green Mile won a 1997 Bram Stoker Award for Best Novel; and Tom Hanks stars in a film of the novel by Frank Darabont, the director of The Shawshank Redemption (from King\u0027s collection Different Seasons). --Fiona Webster"

Too many of us are caught in the happiness trap: we think that we should be happy all or most of the time, and we believe that we can control the circumstances of our lives in order to avoid unpleasant experiences.In reality, every life is touched by disappointment and difficulty. Ironically, it is our fear of negative experiences that keeps us trapped in cycles of unhappiness. Based on the insights and techniques of a new form of psychotherapy called Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Harris offers key principles and techniques for escaping the �happiness trap� to create a full, rich, and meaningful life.Harris shows how mindfulness and acceptance can help us to overcome common emotional problems. He presents the six key techniques of ACT that have been proven effective in helping individuals to:handle painful feelings more effectivelyescape the grip of self-defeating habits, including addictionrise above fears, doubts, and insecuritiescreate a richer and more meaningful life"

      "summary": "Big Nate, a.k.a. middle schooler Nate Wright, is eleven years old, four-and-a-half feet tall, and the wunderkind creation of cartoonist Lincoln Peirce. Nate is also the star of six novelized books to be published by HarperCollins, the first of which debuted on the New York Times children\u0027s best-seller list. This Big Nate Collection collects Peirce\u0027s Big Nate strips, originally published only in newspapers.For those not familiar with Big Nate, think Diary of a Wimpy Kid meets Calvin and Hobbes. Nate is a self-described genius and a sixth-grade Renaissance man equipped with only a #2 pencil and the unshakable belief that he is destined for greatness (a fortune cookie told him so). He fights a daily battle against overzealous teachers, undercooked cafeteria food, and all-around conventionality. He\u0027s the original rebel without a clue, alternately abrasive and endearing to classmates and teachers alike. Throughout Peirce\u0027s Big Nate Collection, Nate blazes an unforgettable trail through the sixth grade at P.S. 38, earning straight As in laughs (and numerous detentions) along the way."

Volume I describes the physical environment in the coastal zone starting with an introduction of coastal engineering, continuing with discussions of mechanics of wave motion, wave and water level predictions, and finally littoral processes. Volume II translates the interaction of the physical environment and coastal structures into design parameters for use in the solution of coastal engineering problems. It discusses planning, analysis, structural features, and structural design as related to physical factors, and shows an example of a coastal engineering problem which utilizes the technical content of material presented in all three volumes. Volume III contains four appendixes including a glossary of coastal engineering terms, a list of symbols, tables and plates, and a subject index."
